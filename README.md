### Internship at NIT Karnataka:
- _**Predicting Relevant News Events for Timeline Summaries using Supervised Machine Learning Technique:**_

  Built an automated text summarizer for generating timeline summaries of news articles using SVM and Linear Regression.

### Projects:
- _**Implementation of Tcp Low Priority in ns-3:**_

  Tcp Low Priority is a Tcp variant for low priority data transfer in which the low priority data utilises only the excess bandwidth.

- _**Implementation of Load/Delay Controller in ns-3:**_

  Load/Delay Controllers are a class of Active Queue Management Algorithms which take into account both the load factor (ratio of packet arrival rate to the packet drain rate) and the queuing delay metric for drop probability calculation.  

- _**Implementation of AOMDV routing protocol in ns-3:**_

  Currently working on this project on AOMDV routing protocol in ns-3. Ad hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector is a routing protocol which computes multiple paths  from a source to a destination during route discovery phase. It is designed for highly dynamic ad hoc networks.

- _**Implementation of Modified Decision Based Median Filter for Impulse Noise Removal:**_

  Median Filter is used to remove noise from corrupted images. This project implemented a modified median filter which
gave better performance compared to basic median filter and extended by implementing a non local median filter based on
the concept of non local means.
